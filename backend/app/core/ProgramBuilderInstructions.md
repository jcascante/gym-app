# Program Builder Instructions

## LET'S EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM STEP BY STEP:

### Step #1
Test the 1RM for all movements you want to include in the plan (Maximum 4 movements)

### Step #2
After one week, test max reps with 80% of 1RM, and calculate weekly jump (lb) and ramp up (in % and lb)

- Use the table to determine the weekly jump, according to the number of reps performed in the test.
- Calculate the weekly jump, expressed in lbs and round it to the nearest available weight.
- Use the table to determine the initial Ramp Up, according to the number of reps performed in the test.
- Calculate the initial Ramp Up, expressed in lbs and round it to the nearest available weight.

**See table examples*

### Step #3
You must perform this test on each movement you want to improve in this plan, a few days after performing the 1RM test. You must start with the previously calculated Base Ramp Up, and increase the weight according to the previous calculation.

## TEST FOR 5RM PROOF

1. Do 5 reps with the Base Ramp Up.
2. Rest at least 3 min.
3. Add weight corresponding to your weekly jump.
4. Do 5 reps.

*Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 until unable to complete 5 reps with perfect technique*

*The heaviest set of 5 reps is your 5x5 target in the program*

## EXAMPLE:

### Initial Data
- **1RM:** 450lbs
- **80% 1RM:** 360lbs
- **Weekly Jump (% according to table):** 4
- **Weekly Jump of:** 20lbs
- **Determines Base Ramp Up 1RM x 65%:** 295lbs

### Base Ramp Up: 295lbs x 5

*rest*
- 315lbs x 5

*rest*
- 335lbs x 5

*rest*
- 355lbs x 5

*rest*
- 375lbs x 5

*rest*
- 395lbs x 5

*rest*
- **415lbs x 3**

***here the test ends and I determine that my 5x5 goal is: 395lbs***

## Step by step for program design:

1. Assign 5x5 from week 1 to 5.
2. Assign 3x3 for week 6.
3. Assign 2x2 for week 7.
4. Assign week 8 as test week.
5. Assign the 5x5 goal in week 5
