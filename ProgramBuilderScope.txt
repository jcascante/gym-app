Program builder module (PBM)

1. PBM aims to help building cleint's programs from templates and from client parameters
2. Templates are base programs with input parameter that will decide base on the program paramters and client parameter how to build the proposed program for the client
3. The flow for program builder should be someting like this

- The cocah creates or selects a client
- Client parameter are added or adjusted
- Base on client paramters, the app should provide the suggested template to use, or selected a different one if required
- Once template is selected, the app should ask for the template parameters
- Once client parameters are added, the template is selected and the template parameters, the app should compute and create a proposed training program
- the proposed training program should be editable so the coach can adjunst if required
- once this is done, the program should be assiged to the client, and the client should be able to see and start adding progress to the program
